                    In her video post from The Toronto Star’s “We are Canadians, but it’s complicated” series, Farah Marfatia (2017) addresses the question of when she has felt most Canadian. She points out that this question is strange-like asking a human when she feels most human. Marfatia explains that she was born and raised in Canada, so she has simply always felt Canadian.

                <p>
                    Marfatia goes on to explore two stereotypes about Canadians: that they are passive and tolerant. Marfatia explains why she believes that Canadians are neither. She tells the story of going to her family cottage. On the way, the family stopped for gas, where a seemingly sweet old lady asked Marfatia’s father when he was planning to blow up the gas station. Describing her rage, Marfatia says this was the moment, in the most quintessentially Canadian landscape, when she felt least Canadian.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marfatia concludes her video post by wondering about this capacity for hatred, and how it shows that Canadians are not tolerant as a people. But she also claims that hope lies in this same challenge, because it means that there is room for education, and for people to learn how to be respectful.
